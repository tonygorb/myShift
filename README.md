# myShift MVP

How does it works ? Easy!
* Setting up your hourly rate, working time, breaks.
* Pick the correct shift (day / night) by clicking the sun/moon button.
* Long hold the big sun/moon button to start counting.
* Long hold the big sun/moon button to stop and save your records.
* View your records on a new activity called "shifts"
** You need to initialize firebase authentication + create a database for users in order to make that work!
